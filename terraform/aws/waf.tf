# AWS WAFv2 web ACL for the MCP API Gateway stage.
#
# Provides per-IP rate limiting and AWS-managed attack signature rules in
# front of the public /mcp endpoint. The endpoint itself has no auth, so
# this is the primary line of defense against abuse (denial-of-wallet,
# scrapers, known exploit payloads).
#
# Set `waf_rate_limit_per_5min = 0` to skip creating the WAF entirely.

  # Create this MCP's OWN web ACL only when it is not delegating to the

  # web ACL + $1/mo per rule regardless of traffic, so a dedicated ACL per MCP
  # is ~$8/mo of fixed cost; the shared ACL carries this MCP's rate limit as its
  # own Host-scoped rule instead.
  #
