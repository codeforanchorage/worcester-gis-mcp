# CloudWatch alarms for the MCP server.

# Surfaces Lambda errors/throttles, API Gateway 5XX spikes, 4XX probing
# patterns, and Lambda duration approaching the configured timeout.
#
# If `alarm_sns_topic_arn` is set, alarms notify that topic. Otherwise the
# alarms are created with no actions — you can still see them in the
# CloudWatch console and wire notifications up later.
